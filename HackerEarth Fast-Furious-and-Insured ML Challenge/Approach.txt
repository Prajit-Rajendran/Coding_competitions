Random forest regressor is chosen as the backbone algorithm for amount prediction
Transfer learning on MobileNet (Computer vision) is used as the backbone for condition classification

Amount prediction:

Missing data was imputed using bfill
Dropped expiry date feature
Standard scaling was used for numerical features
Label encoding was used for Insurance_company
Train-validation split of 80-20
Trained RF regressor
MAE used as evaluation metric- obtained 2050.06

Condition prediction:

Resize images to 224 x 224
