Random forest regressor is chosen as the backbone algorithm

Missing data was imputed using bfill

Standard scaling was used for numerical features

One hot encoding was used for cloud_level

turbine_status, datetime and tracking_id were dropped

Train-validation split of 80-20

Trained 5 different RF regressors with different random state

MAE used as evaluation metric

Used average of ensemble as test prediction
