-Convert images to latent vectors of size 10 using the Variational Autoencoder approach
-Combine with 14 other features (except time and date) to get data vectors for size 24
-Train LSTM to predict cloud cover % over 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min
-Take last 3,6,9 or 12 data points in each test scenario set and predict the cloud cover based on the trained LSTM models
